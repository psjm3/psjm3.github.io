            <h2>Pippa - Peace Lily</h2>
            <p>The peace lily is native to tropical rainforests, specifically those of South and Central America. It’s thought it was brought to Europe some time in the late 1800s and it's adapted well to the UK’s less than tropical conditions. As exotic as it looks, its light and water needs are modest. It will cope in quite low light, though prefers indirect light, and as long as its humidity needs are met it's generally happy and should flower throughout spring. It will appreciate a feed with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer. As well as being an elegant beauty, this plant is a hardworking air-purifyer.</p>
            <p><strong>Watering: </strong>(Light) She is pretty tough and will usually bounce back from a missed watering. Water her when the top inch of soil feels dry. </p>
            <p><strong>Sunlight: </strong>She's easy when it comes to light, managing in most conditions, though she'll flower more in a brighter spot.</p>
            <p><strong>Humidity: </strong>She loves humidity. Mist her every few days to keep her happy.</p>

            <h2>Mick - Dragon Tree</h2>
            <p>The corn plant is a very common outdoor plant across Africa. It grows so widely that in many parts of the continent it’s used for hedging. It grows slowly, but easily, and can eventually reach a height of 15 metres. A healthy wild plant will grow fragrant flowers, followed by small yellow fruit. To keep yours in a good mood, remember: generous with the misting, sparing with the watering. And give it plenty of light. It will survive in light shade, but new growth will be weak. It will also love you if you give it a feed with liquid fertiliser once a month in spring and summer.</p>
            <p><strong>Watering: </strong>(Light) He’s low maintenance on water. He’s very drought tolerant, let his soil dry out completely before giving him a drink.</p>
            <p><strong>Sunlight: </strong>He's happy in anything from light shade to bright, soft light. Keep him out of harsh direct sun.</p>
            <p><strong>Humidity: </strong>As we all do, he needs moisture to keep looking fresh. He’ll love a spray with a mister every few days.</p>

            <h2>Bertie - Boston Fern</h2>
            <p>You’ll find Boston Ferns in the wild in humid, shady areas, like swamps and forests, in South and Central America, the West Indies and Africa. As a houseplant, they really became popular with the Victorians - those guys absolutely loved an exotic houseplant - thriving in the poorly lit, likely damp homes of the 1800s. When looking after one at home, the rule is to never let a Boston fern dry out. Make sure to keep the soil moist and humidity level high. Although it's very tempting, try to resist touching their fronds as they really don't like it and it might turn them brown. To encourage lots of healthy growth, give it a feed with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer.</p>
            <p><strong>Watering: </strong>(Frequent)She likes moist soil, so check her weekly and water whenever the top inch of soil is dry. Let any excess drain off.</p>
            <p><strong>Sunlight: </strong>Like a lot of ferns, she’s used to living in partial shade, so she’s ideal for a room with lower light.</p>
            <p><strong>Humidity: </strong>She really really loves humidity. Mist her a couple of times a week</p>
